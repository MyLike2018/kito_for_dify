## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Kito-dify** Plugin ("the Plugin") operates with respect to your data. The Plugin is designed to enhance Dify applications by providing AI host capabilities through Kito.

Please note: This policy specifically covers the data handled by the "Kito-dify" Plugin. Dify’s platform itself, and any other plugins or services you use, will have their own privacy policies.

### 1. Data Collected and Processed by the Plugin
The Kito-dify plugin processes the following types of data:

* Command Instructions or File Content: When your Dify application uses the Plugin, the command instructions or file content you provide (or generated by the large language model) are passed to the Plugin.

* Kito API Key: For the Plugin to function, you (as the owner/user of the Dify application) must provide your personal Kito API Key within the Dify Plugin settings. This key is used solely for authenticating requests to the Kito API.

The Plugin itself DOES NOT collect, store, or log any personal user data, command instructions, or execution results.

### 2. How Data is Used
The data processed by the Plugin is used exclusively for the following purposes:

Executing CommToolands: Your command instructions or file content and Kito API Key are transmitted to the Kito Workder Node Service(https://node2.cloudsoc.vip) to execute the specified tool or service.

Returning Results: The execution results obtained from the Kito API are immediately returned to your Dify application for further processing by your large language model or workflow.

### 3. Data Storage

* By the Plugin: The kito-dify Plugin does not store any command instructions, file content, execution results, or your Kito API Key. It acts solely as a conduit between your Dify application and the Kito API.

* By Dify: Your Kito API Key is stored securely within your Dify instance’s plugin settings, managed by the Dify platform itself. The storage and handling of this credential are governed by Dify’s own privacy and security policies.

* By Kito: When the Plugin makes a request to the Kito API, command execution is handled by Kito. We encourage you to review Kito’s Privacy Policy to understand how they handle data transmitted to their service: https://kito.cloudsoc.vip/privacy-policy

### 4. Third-Party Services
The kito-dify Plugin relies on the Kito API to execute commands. Your command instructions and API Key are shared with Kito for this purpose.

### 5. Your Control and Consent
By providing your Kito API Key in the Dify Plugin settings, you consent to the Plugin using that key to make requests to the Kito API on your behalf. You retain full control over your Kito API Key within your Dify environment, including the ability to revoke or change it at any time through the Dify UI.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated plugin package and its documentation. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.
